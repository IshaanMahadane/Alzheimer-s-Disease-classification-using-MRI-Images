# 🧠 Alzheimer’s Disease Classification from MRI Images

A deep learning–based project that classifies MRI brain scans into different stages of Alzheimer’s Disease using **VGG16 Transfer Learning** and **TensorFlow**.  
The model achieves high accuracy and demonstrates the use of **transfer learning**, **class imbalance handling (SMOTE)**, and **visual interpretability** in medical imaging.

## 📘 Project Overview

Early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease is crucial for timely intervention and patient care.  
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **transfer learning (VGG16)** to classify MRI scans into four categories:

- 🧩 Non-Demented  
- ⚠️ Very Mild Demented  
- ⚠️ Mild Demented  
- 🚨 Moderate Demented

The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of **2,500+ MRI images**, achieving **~94% accuracy** on the test set.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Transfer Learning (VGG16):** Pretrained model fine-tuned for MRI classification.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, augmentation, and encoding.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Used **SMOTE** to generate synthetic samples for minority classes.
- **Regularization:** Early stopping, dropout, and learning-rate scheduling.
- **Visualization:** Confusion matrix, loss and accuracy curves plotted with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
